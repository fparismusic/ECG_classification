# ECG_classification

The goal is to implement an algorithm that is able to classify ECG waveforms into five classes of Arrhythmia by taking into account only rhythmic features. 
In order to solve such a task, we will have to extract a precise feature vector and train a classier on the MIT-BIH dataset.
